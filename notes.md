# Final Thoughts

This was a hefty assignment to complete. Took me 3 days in total to do. Even so it was a good problem to work on with the film/tv based API.

Improvements to be made:

* Improve the overall design
    - modern & sleek
    - button & form styling
    - add some icons from fontawesome
    - Cast & Crew cards & sections

* Improve the styling on larger screens
    - the ResultsList could be done better
    - form styling on bigger screens

* Add tests for logic heavy components such as Details & Search
    - Snapshots
    - functionality

* Fix a bug that occurs when the user transitions from actor to film/tv show
    - This is being handled by the Error boundary at the minute

* Add codesplitting/lazy loading to the application using React.lazy & Suspense
